# Brief-Analysis-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

Welcome to the Nobel Prize Data Analysis project! This project analyzes Nobel Prize data from 1901 to 2023, with a focus on identifying patterns related to gender, nationality, and multiple Nobel Prize winners. The task involves answering several key questions using the available dataset. Below, Iâ€™ll walk you through the analysis and explain the key findings.

## Task Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Nobel Prize dataset and answer the following questions:
1. **What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?**
2. **Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?**
3. **Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?**
4. **Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?**
5. **Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?**

## What the Code Does

The analysis uses the Nobel Prize dataset and provides answers to the above questions. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

### 1. Most Common Gender & Birth Country
The code finds the gender and birth country with the highest number of Nobel laureates. These results are stored as variables `top_gender` and `top_country`.

### 2. US-Born Nobel Prize Winners by Decade
The dataset is analyzed to identify the decade with the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners. The result is stored as an integer variable `max_decade_usa`.

### 3. Highest Proportion of Female Laureates by Decade & Category
The code computes the proportion of female laureates by decade and Nobel Prize category, and identifies the combination with the highest proportion of women. This information is stored in a dictionary called `max_female_dict`.

### 4. First Woman to Win a Nobel Prize
The first woman to win a Nobel Prize is identified, along with the category she won. The results are stored as strings `first_woman_name` and `first_woman_category`.

### 5. Multiple Nobel Prize Winners
The code identifies individuals or organizations that have won more than one Nobel Prize. The names of these repeat winners are stored in a list called `repeat_list`.

### Visualizations
The project also includes visualizations to represent:
- The proportion of US-born winners over the decades.
- The proportion of female laureates by decade and category.
- A bar chart showing individuals or organizations with multiple Nobel Prize wins.

## How It Works

The code processes the Nobel Prize dataset using **pandas** for data manipulation and **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for visualizations. The main steps include:
1. Loading the dataset and performing data wrangling to clean and organize the data.
2. Performing group-by operations to analyze the data and compute the answers.
3. Displaying the results and visualizations for further insights.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the Nobel Prize data, helping to identify key trends related to gender, nationality, and repeated winners. It was a great opportunity to practice data analysis, visualization, and answer interesting questions about one of the most prestigious awards in the world.
